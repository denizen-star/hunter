I’ve helped Fortune 500s and startups alike transform their capabilities — whether that’s migrating 100+ applications to the cloud, delivering $100M+ in AI-driven revenue gains, or building orgs from 10 to 60+ engineers while cutting contractor overhead by 60%.

What I bring to the table:
Strategic Data & Engineering Leadership , Full lifecycle execution — from vision to delivery — across GCP, AWS, Snowflake, Databricks, and beyond.
AI/ML Enablement, Hands-on technical leadership and architecture to deliver real-world insights and engineering best practices.
Scalable Architecture, End-to-end cloud modernization, microservices, and self-service data platforms.
Team & Culture Builder: Cultivating curiosity, speed, and trust across cross-functional teams.
Business Impact First: Whether it’s cost savings or revenue growth, everything I do is aligned to high-impact outcomes.

My passion? Turning complex problems into elegant solutions that move the business forward — and mentoring the next generation of technical leaders & engineers along the way.

Chris Hopkins recently interviewed me for an episode of his podcast and it was a real pleasure to catch up. Having a sense of humor is important, no doubt the phrase of the day for me was "game changer" :) Feel free to share or ping me if you'd like to discuss any of these topics further.

Veterans Day is a chance to acknowledge the men and women who took an oath to protect the United States. Service brings long days and harder nights, a sense of responsibility that rarely fades. It grows from teamwork trust and the quiet promise to stand with the person beside you no matter how uncertain the world becomes.
To every veteran and every family who supported them, I thank you. Your strength and your sacrifice matter more than words can express. Our nation holds a debt to you and honoring it means offering care support and gratitude throughout the year, not only today.
Many organizations help carry that commitment forward, here are a few:

The stand out things about Li that may not come through in his resume would be:
1. His high standards and expectations of both himself and his team that are balanced with his commitment to the importance of learning and growth for everyone on the team. If you worked with Li and didn't learn something, it was because you didn't want to. The entirety of my sql skills today are because Li made the time to teach me & get me started. Even when he has back-to-back meetings, I have seen him make time to mentor someone.
2. I've also always respected his direct approach and even when we disagreed - I knew we both respected each other enough to speak honestly. 
3. Li is one of the most intelligent/quick-witted individuals that you'll have the opportunity to work with.

I'd welcome the opportunity to work with Li again.The stand out things about Li that may not come through in his resume would be: 1.

Subject: Excited to Connect - Let's Grab Virtual Coffee!

Hi Test,

A huge thank you for accepting my connection request! I'm excited to start building our professional network.

I noticed that we both work in the finance industry, and as someone who's passionate about leveraging technology to drive innovation, I'd love to hear your thoughts on the latest trends. What do you think is the most exciting application of AI in finance right now? Have you seen any breakthroughs or innovations that have particularly caught your attention?

I'm also curious to learn more about your experience scaling technical skills within your team. How did you approach it, and what were some key takeaways for you? Your insights would be invaluable to me!

Lastly, I'd love to hear about a successful project you led that utilized Snowflake or GCP. Can you share an example with me?

I was thinking of grabbing virtual coffee (a 15-20 minute chat) to explore these topics further and get to know each other better. No pressure, just a casual conversation! Let me know if you're interested, and we can schedule a time that works for you.

Looking forward to hearing back from you!
