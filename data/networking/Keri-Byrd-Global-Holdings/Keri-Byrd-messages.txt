Hi Keri,

I wanted to take a moment to thank you for accepting my connection request on LinkedIn! As we share a common interest in the innovative applications of artificial intelligence (AI) and data science, I thought it would be great to have a quick 1:1 conversation.

I'm also curious to hear a success story from your experience at Global Holdings. What were some key takeaways or lessons learned from a particularly successful project or initiative?

Would you be open to a 15-20 minute virtual coffee chat? I'd love to grab a virtual cup of coffee (or tea) and explore these topics further in a casual setting. No agenda, just an opportunity for us to connect and share our thoughts on the intersection of AI & data science.

Looking forward to hearing back from you!
