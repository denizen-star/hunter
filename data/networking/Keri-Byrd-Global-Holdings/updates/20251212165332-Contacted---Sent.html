As we share a common interest in the innovative applications of artificial intelligence (AI) and data science, I thought it would be great to have a quick 1:1 conversation.</p><p><br></p><p>As someone who's passionate about leveraging AI in our work, I'd love to hear from you about what you think is the most innovative application of AI you've seen in your role as Chief Data Officer at Global Holdings. Are there any specific projects or initiatives that stand out to you? Additionally, how do you stay up-to-date with the latest developments in data science and analytics?</p><p><br></p><p>I'm also curious to hear a success story. What were some key takeaways or lessons learned from a particularly successful project or initiative?</p><p><br></p><p>Would you be open to a 15-20 minute virtual coffee chat? I'd love to grab a virtual cup of coffee (or tea) and explore these topics further in a casual setting. No agenda, just an opportunity for us to connect and share our thoughts on the intersection of AI &amp; data science.</p><p><br></p><p>Looking forward to hearing back from you!</p><p><br></p><p>Best regards,</p><p>Kervin</p><p><br></p><p>(My calendar availability https://calendar.app.google/xyKqKGNWNoKzVy4u6 or share a couple of open slots that will work for you in the upcoming days)</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p></div>
