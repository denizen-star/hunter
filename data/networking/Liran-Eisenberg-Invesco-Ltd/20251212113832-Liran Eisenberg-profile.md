AboutAbout
With over 25 years of experience, I specialize in building and scaling high-performance teams, modernizing platforms, and driving enterprise value through data engineering, AI, and analytics. I’ve helped Fortune 500s and startups alike transform their capabilities — whether that’s migrating 100+ applications to the cloud, delivering $100M+ in AI-driven revenue gains, or building orgs from 10 to 60+ engineers while cutting contractor overhead by 60%.
What I bring to the table:
Strategic Data & Engineering Leadership , Full lifecycle execution — from vision to delivery — across GCP, AWS, Snowflake, Databricks, and beyond.
AI/ML Enablement, Hands-on technical leadership and architecture to deliver real-world insights and engineering best practices.
Scalable Architecture, End-to-end cloud modernization, microservices, and self-service data platforms.
Team & Culture Builder: Cultivating curiosity, speed, and trust across cross-functional teams.
Business Impact First: Whether it’s cost savings or revenue growth, everything I do is aligned to high-impact outcomes.
My passion? Turning complex problems into elegant solutions that move the business forward — and mentoring the next generation of technical leaders & engineers along the way.
Let’s connect if you’re looking to scale your data vision or explore transformative leadership in engineering.

Chris Hopkins recently interviewed me for an episode of his podcast and it was a real pleasure to catch up. Having a sense of humor is important, no doubt the phrase of the day for me was "game changer" :) Feel free to share or ping me if you'd like to discuss any of these topics further.

Veterans Day is a chance to acknowledge the men and women who took an oath to protect the United States. Service brings long days and harder nights, a sense of responsibility that rarely fades. It grows from teamwork trust and the quiet promise to stand with the person beside you no matter how uncertain the world becomes.
To every veteran and every family who supported them, I thank you. Your strength and your sacrifice matter more than words can express. Our nation holds a debt to you and honoring it means offering care support and gratitude throughout the year, not only today.
Many organizations help carry that commitment forward, here are a few:

Lee is the person you want to go to if you have to present something and you want great statistics. The research and data he provides are top notch. He's also willing to have the difficult conversations that others sometimes avoid.

The stand out things about Li that may not come through in his resume would be:
1. His high standards and expectations of both himself and his team that are balanced with his commitment to the importance of learning and growth for everyone on the team. If you worked with Li and didn't learn something, it was because you didn't want to. The entirety of my sql skills today are because Li made the time to teach me & get me started. Even when he has back-to-back meetings, I have seen him make time to mentor someone.
2. I've also always respected his direct approach and even when we disagreed - I knew we both respected each other enough to speak honestly.
3. Li is one of the most intelligent/quick-witted individuals that you'll have the opportunity to work with.
I'd welcome the opportunity to work with Li again.The stand out things about Li that may not come through in his resume would be: 1.
