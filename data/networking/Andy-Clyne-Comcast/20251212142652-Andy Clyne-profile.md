I reported to Andrew for almost 5 years at MasterCard. He was a demanding but fair person to work for. He really taught me how to think outside the box, an ability I have always admired about him. He has the ability to see the big picture. Andrew took what was a small department and built it to over 200 employees and contractors. It was a pleasure to work for him. - Cindy CrumpI reported to Andrew for almost 5 years at MasterCard. He was a demanding but fair person to work for.
