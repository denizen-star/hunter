AboutAbout
Good at reading the room, staying flexible, and finding the right approach for each situation. I don’t shy away from responsibility and always try to make things easier for the team. Communication comes naturally, and I enjoy helping people feel heard and understood. I stay focused, even when things get hectic.
I help organizations turn strategy into systems that actually work. As a Strategic Program Director at Andersen, I manage complex IT programs across North America - connecting people, data, and infrastructure to make technology feel seamless. Most of my work revolves around CRM implementations (Salesforce), enterprise integrations, and helping teams see their data in a clearer, more actionable way.
I started out in customer support, learning firsthand what clients value most (clarity, reliability, and being heard). That mindset still shapes how I work today. I like building frameworks that adapt to change instead of breaking under it.
At Andersen, we focus on long-term partnerships. We help companies modernize their systems, improve transparency, and make confident, data-backed decisions. If that’s something you’re exploring, I’m always open to sharing ideas or experiences that might help.Good at reading the room, staying flexible, and finding the right approach for each situation.

Your circle shapes your future.
Some feed your fire - others fear your flame.
Spend time with dreamers,
you’ll start dreaming bigger.
Spend time with doubters,
you’ll start shrinking your dreams.
The right circle doesn’t just inspire -
they stretch what you believe is possible.
How growth really happens 👇
1. They expand your thinking
Sharper questions. Honest mirrors.
New angles you never saw before.
2. They celebrate without comparison
Your win fuels theirs.
Their success fuels yours.
3. They challenge your comfort
No fake praise. No safe silence.
Just the push that moves you forward.
4. They energize your belief
Every talk leaves you clearer, lighter,
and ready to move.
5. They model discipline over drama
Focus is their default.
Consistency is their superpower.
6. They make you believe bigger.
They see your potential
long before you do.
7. They hold you accountable to your dreams
They don’t chase you - but remind you.
of the vision you promised yourself.
Keep people who see your spark.
Who challenge you -
not change you.
And who remind you what’s possible
when you stop playing small.
♻ Repost to help someone upgrade their circle and rise higher.
