We’re expanding our product team at JustAnswer with a Staff Product Manager role that represents an exceptional, high-impact opportunity for the right leader. This fully remote role sits at the center of our platform: the middle of the conversation, where Experts troubleshoot, diagnose, and deliver real solutions to customers. You’ll shape how humans and AI work together in real time, directly improving Expert performance, Customer Quality, and trust in the experience.
Why this role matters:
• Mission-critical ownership of the tools Experts use to deliver accuracy and efficiency
• Frontline AI innovation, including leading work on our AI-driven Conversation Wizard
• Strategic visibility across Expert Operations, Engineering, UX, and Analytics
• The chance to build from the ground up and define the next generation of expert tools
• Collaborative culture with leaders who value clarity, initiative, and impact
Why I love working at JustAnswer (and why others do too):
• 100% remote
• Flexible PTO
• 11 paid holidays
• $500 remote office stipend
• $360 wellness stipend
• Free JustAnswer membership
• A Minister of Fun who brings games, contests, and connection to our global teams
• And the coolest part: we’re an AI-first company. We empower and train every employee to use AI daily, experiment boldly, and help shape how AI transforms our work. It’s an incredible moment to be here.
If you’re excited about shaping how human expertise and AI come together at scale, this is a genuine career-defining opportunity.
Know someone who might be a great fit? I’d love to connect.

Great to see Pearl's mission featured in the New York Post and on the front page of The Deep View. This conversation is more critical than ever because we have to be honest about the serious dangers of unchecked AI in healthcare. 🩺
⚠️ The Danger is Real ⚠️
AI is making terrifying mistakes. We've seen it generate racially biased summaries, forge medical citations, and play a role in killing teens. The "move fast and break things" culture can't apply when lives are at stake.
This isn't just reckless; it's malpractice.
✅ The Best of Both Worlds ✅
The answer isn't choosing between flawed AI and slow, expensive in-person visits. The real future is combining the two.
That’s what we built at Pearl.com. Our verified doctors and other professionals use AI as a tool to work more efficiently. This gives you the best of both worlds:
* Higher Quality: Answers from a real, licensed professional are far more reliable and empathetic than any chatbot.
* Faster & Cheaper: By using AI to augment their workflow, our experts can provide you with help that's more affordable and quicker than a traditional face-to-face appointment.
It’s a new model for professional services that doesn't gamble with your health. Stop choosing between accuracy, speed, and cost. Get the best of both worlds.

These were fabricated with a novel "dual-fiber electrospinning" process and exhibited high power output and durability in hydrogen/air fuel cells, significantly outperforming Nafion benchmark materials (>100% power increase, >50% durability improvement).

During my senior year at Trinity University I worked in collaboration with 4 other engineers to design and demonstrate a process for the production of cellulosic ethanol, a biofuel. My primary responsibility was to optimize the enzymatic hydrolysis of pecan husks (the cellulose source) into fermentable sugars (which are then converted into ethanol via fermentation).During my senior year at Trinity University I worked in collaboration with 4 other engineers to design and demonstrate a process for the production of cellulosic ethanol, a biofuel.
