Subject: Let's Catch Up!

Hi Andrew,

I just wanted to say thank you for accepting my invitation to connect on LinkedIn! I'm excited to learn more about your experiences and insights, especially in the field of data strategy.

As someone who works closely with Comcast (and has even been impressed by their innovative approach to data management), I'd love to hear your thoughts on how their data strategy can be applied to other industries. What are some potential challenges you foresee? I'm always looking for new perspectives and ideas, and I think our conversation could be really valuable.

If you're open to it, I was thinking we could grab a virtual coffee (15-20 minutes) to chat more about your experiences as Chief Data Officer at Visa. What were some of the most significant lessons you learned during that tenure? And can you share an example of how you've used data analytics to drive business decisions in a previous role?

No pressure, just a casual conversation! Let me know if you're interested and we can schedule a time that works for you.

Looking forward to hearing from you,

[Your Name]
