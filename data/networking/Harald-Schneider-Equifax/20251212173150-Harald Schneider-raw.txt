Now available: our latest ACN ViewPoints on Artificial Intelligence and the board.

"As artificial intelligence (AI) reshapes the business landscape, audit committees must develop a degree of AI fluency to keep pace with evolving risks and opportunities." 

Key takeaways include: 

- Strategic alignment drives value and technology tools yield the greatest impact when linked to business priorities.
- Rapid shifts require boards to collaborate more across functions.
- Oversight responsibilities are expanding as policies and expectations shift.
- Audit committees are fostering exploration to support emerging opportunities.

Honored to present on @Equifax D&A innovation and AI at our 2025 Investor Day. Your AI is only as good as your data — and differentiated data on the foundation of the hashtag#EFXCloud and our custom data fabric has fueled our transformation to the hashtag#NewEFX. An exciting conversation that was capped off by the ringing of the hashtag#NYSE Closing Bell!
