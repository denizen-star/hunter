# Job Hunting Follow Ups — One Pager (Template)

Purpose: Systematize outreach and follow-ups to increase interview conversion.

## Problem
Applicants lose momentum due to inconsistent follow-ups and poor organization.

## Use Cases:
a. As a user I want to be able to provide my resume and it will be used for every job unless I descide to change it for a customized version. The system will support and save the resume provided.

c.  As a user I want to provide a job description the application will create a folder for this job with the name of the company and the position name <company>-<jobtitle>

d. As a user I want the application to keep a copy of the job description in a markdown in the <comapany>-<jobtitle> folder called <datetimeest>-<comapany>-<jobtitle>.md

e. as I user I want to be able to change my base resume for a new resume if I have a more bespoke version of my resume that I deem more related to the job description.

f. As a user I want to the application to use <datetimeest>-<comapany>-<jobtitle>.md correlate it/ analyze it in comparison with the resume and provide a summary and a bullet list of the characteristics of my skills are a match and the descriptions in the job that are not in the resume and create a markdown names <Jobtitle>-Qualifications.md. 

g. The application will then use the <Jobtitle>- Qualifications.md within this <company>-<jobtitle> folder and write an ellocuent cover letter that integrates 50% of the soft skills required in the job as part of my streghts filename: <Myfullname>-<company>-<jobtitle>-intro.md

h. As a user I want the application to rewrite my job descriptions based on the findings within the <Jobtitle>- Qualifications.md to be more directely correlated to the description. Each bullet per job description should be short, direct and professional. filename <Myfullname>-<company>-<jobtitle>-Resume.md

i. As a user I want the application to create a summary of actions, suggested next steps, followed by the content of <Jobtitle>- Qualifications.md, a page for the <Myfullname>-<company>-<jobtitle>-<intro>.md followed by the new <Myfullname-<company>-<jobtitle>-Resume.md. filename: <datetimeEST>-Summary-<company>-<jobtitle>.md

i. (here is where the app starts)I want a simple html page that will list all the <datetimeEST>-Summary-<company>-<jobtitle>.md with links to the files and folder. I will follow up with more instructions once this if complete.
