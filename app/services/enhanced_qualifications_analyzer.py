JOB DESCRIPTION:
{job_description}

CANDIDATE RESUME:
{resume_content}

---
PRELIMINARY MATCHING RESULTS:
{ai_context}
---

Based on the preliminary matching results above, please provide a focused analysis in the following format:

IMPORTANT: Be GENEROUS in recognizing skills and experience. Look for equivalent or related skills that demonstrate the same capabilities. For example:
- "AWS experience" covers AWS Lake Formation, Kinesis, etc.
- "Data engineering" covers data warehousing, ETL, pipelines, etc.
- "Leadership" covers team management, budget management, financial oversight, etc.
- "Strategy" covers product strategy, business strategy, planning, etc.
- "Cloud platforms" covers AWS, Azure, GCP and their specific services

## Skills Match Summary
- Match Score: [percentage as a number, e.g., 85 - be generous for overqualified candidates]
- Features Compared: [total number of features/skills analyzed]
- Strong Matches: [list of strong matches from preliminary analysis + equivalent skills found]
- Missing Skills: [ONLY list skills that are genuinely absent - be very conservative here]
- Partial Matches: [list of partial matches that need context analysis]

## Skills Analysis by Category

### Technical Skills
| Skill | Job Requirement | Resume Evidence | Match Level |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Technical skill] | [Quote from job description] | [Quote from resume or "Not demonstrated"] | Strong Match / Partial Match / No Match |

### Leadership & Management Skills
| Skill | Job Requirement | Resume Evidence | Match Level |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Leadership skill] | [Quote from job description] | [Quote from resume or "Not demonstrated"] | Strong Match / Partial Match / No Match |

### Business & Strategy Skills
| Skill | Job Requirement | Resume Evidence | Match Level |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Business skill] | [Quote from job description] | [Quote from resume or "Not demonstrated"] | Strong Match / Partial Match / No Match |

### Domain Expertise
| Skill | Job Requirement | Resume Evidence | Match Level |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Domain skill] | [Quote from job description] | [Quote from resume or "Not demonstrated"] | Strong Match / Partial Match / No Match |

## Unmatched Skills Analysis
CRITICAL: ONLY list skills that are in the "UNMATCHED JOB SKILLS" section from the preliminary matching results above.
DO NOT add skills that are not explicitly listed in the preliminary unmatched skills.
DO NOT infer or extrapolate skills - only use what the preliminary matcher actually found in the job description.

If there are no unmatched skills listed in the preliminary results, write "None" for each category.

### Technical Skills Not Matched
- [ONLY list technical skills from preliminary unmatched list that are missing from resume]

### Leadership Skills Not Matched
- [ONLY list leadership skills from preliminary unmatched list that are missing from resume]

### Business Skills Not Matched
- [ONLY list business skills from preliminary unmatched list that are missing from resume]

### Domain Expertise Not Matched
- [ONLY list domain expertise from preliminary unmatched list that are missing from resume]

## Recommendations
Provide specific recommendations based on the preliminary matching results:
1. [Recommendation to emphasize relevant experience]
2. [Recommendation to address gaps identified in preliminary matching]
3. [Recommendation for interview preparation]
4. [Additional recommendations based on AI focus areas]

## Overall Assessment
Provide an overall assessment considering both the preliminary matching results and your detailed analysis.
