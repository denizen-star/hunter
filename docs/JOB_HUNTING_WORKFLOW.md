# Job Hunting Workflow: Why Hunter is Essential

Job hunting—real hunting, not passive searching—is basically a full-time job. Recruiters expect every message tailored to their company, so standing out requires tracking a ton of information. Here's my daily workflow and where Hunter fits in.

## Phase I: Application Process

**Goal**: Find jobs, analyze fit, and submit tailored applications.

### Step 1: Search LinkedIn
Log into LinkedIn (my industry's preferred job board).

### Step 2: Filter Jobs
Search by area, then filter by:
- Remote/hybrid/city preferences
- Pay range
- Job title
- Company

### Step 3: Review Matches
Browse results that match my criteria.

### Step 4: Capture Job Posting
When I find a match, I copy the entire job posting (screenshot 1) and paste it into a **new application in Hunter**.

### Step 5: Extract Key Info & Start Analysis
In Hunter, I extract:
- **Position name** (creates unique ID)
- **Company name** (creates folder structure)
- **Job link** (for checking if still open)

Then I hit **"Analyze & Create Application"**. Hunter's analysis takes 3-5 minutes, so it runs in the background while I work on the application form.

### Step 6: Fill Application Form (Parallel to Analysis)
**Priority: Speed of submission.** While Hunter analyzes, I immediately open the job posting link and fill out the form fields:

**6.1. Contact Info & Basic Fields**
- Name, email, phone
- Address/location
- Basic application questions

**6.2. Resume Upload**
- If "Connect with LinkedIn" is available, use it (best ATS pass-through)
- Otherwise, upload my ATS-optimized resume (docx + PDF)
- Keep a well-formatted version ready for human readers

**6.3. Job History**
I have an Excel file with columns:
- Job name
- Position
- Start date
- End date
- Description
- Skill highlights (critical for tech roles)

I copy-paste from Excel to fill the work history section quickly.

**6.4. Cover Letter Checkpoint**
If the form requires a cover letter, I pause here and wait for Hunter's analysis to complete. Otherwise, I continue filling the form.

### Step 7: Review Match Score (When Analysis Completes)
Once Hunter finishes (usually by the time I'm done with basic fields), I check the **% match** based on AI skills extraction and comparison.

### Step 8: Review Analysis (If Cover Letter Required)
If I need a cover letter, I click **"View Summary"** and check tabs:
- Job Description
- Raw Entry
- Skills
- Research
- Qualifications Analysis

Then jump to **Updates & Notes**.

### Step 9: Get Cover Letter (Only If Required)
If the application requires a cover letter:
- Go to Hunter's **Templates** tab
- Select the **bespoke cover letter**
- Copy the text and paste into my Google Docs template (designed to stand out)
- Replace placeholders with position-specific info
- Remove redundant paragraphs
- Save as PDF and attach to the job submission

**If no cover letter required**: Skip directly to submission.

### Step 10: Submit Application
Hit submit on the application form. Speed is the priority—I don't wait for analysis unless a cover letter is mandatory.

### Step 11: Document Submission in Hunter
After submitting:
- Go to Hunter's **Updates & Notes** tab
- Set status to **"Applied"**
- Copy any cover letter content (if used) into the notes box
- Save the status

### Step 12: Verify Confirmation
Check email for:
- Confirmation receipt
- Email verification requirements
- Any additional steps needed

**Note**: By running Hunter's analysis in parallel with form filling, I minimize submission delay. The only pause is when a cover letter is required—then I wait for analysis to complete before crafting it.
