## Common Questions

### Q: Why is my match score lower than I expected?
**A**: The new system calculates match scores based on job requirements, not your skills. This gives a more realistic view of how well you fit the job. A 60% match means you meet 60% of what the job requires.

### Q: What's the difference between exact matches and partial matches?
**A**: 
- **Exact Matches**: Skills that appear exactly the same in both your resume and the job description
- **Partial Matches**: Skills that are similar or related (e.g., "data analysis" matches "data analytics")

### Q: How can I improve my match score?
**A**: 
1. **Develop Missing Skills**: Work on skills that frequently appear in unmatched lists
2. **Update Your Resume**: Make sure all your relevant skills are clearly stated
3. **Gain Experience**: Look for opportunities to develop skills in areas where you're weak

### Q: What if I disagree with the analysis?
**A**: The system provides a foundation, but you know your experience best. Use the analysis as a starting point and adjust based on your knowledge of the role and your qualifications.

### Q: How often should I update my skills database?
**A**: Update your resume and skills whenever you:
- Learn new technologies or skills
- Complete new projects
- Get new certifications
- Change roles or responsibilities
